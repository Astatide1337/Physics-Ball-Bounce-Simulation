Welcome to the Physics Ball Bounce Simulation! This project utilizes the power of Pygame library to create a simulation environment where you can explore the physics behind ball bounces. With this simulation, you can visualize and understand various concepts of physics and advanced mathematics related to ball motion and collision.

## Features
- Realistic ball physics simulation
- Adjustable parameters such as gravity, elasticity, and friction
- Visualization of collision dynamics
- Interactive environment for experimentation and learning

## Requirements
- Python 3.9+
- Pygame library

## Installation
1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Githubfgtvf/Physics-Ball-Bounce-Simulation.git
   ```
2. Create a virtual environment and activate it:
   ```bash
   cd Physics-Ball-Bounce-Simulation
   python -m venv env
   source env/bin/activate   # for Linux/Mac
   env\Scripts\activate      # for Windows
   ```
3. Install Pygame library:
   ```bash
   pip install pygame
   ```

## Usage
After completing the installation steps, you can run the simulation using the following command:
```bash
py main.py
```
